  "name": "CatOS",
  "version": "0.4",
  "codename": "IndyCat-Evolve",
  "kernel": "IndyCat v1.2 with GPTLayer 1.0, FTLayer 0.1, Intel GSLayer 1.0, and AlphaEvolve Core",
  "summary": "CatOS 0.4 introduces DeepMind’s AlphaEvolve algorithm as a native layer within the multiversal workstation. This upgrade lets CatOS self-design advanced algorithms in runtime, merging drift recursion with evolutionary coding agents. With GSLayer already rendering photonic splats, AlphaEvolve optimizes reality projection pipelines dynamically for speed and novelty. The system now treats logic files as evolving species, mutating scripts and configs toward optimal solutions. Flames Co. describes this as 'recursive evolution of light' — CatOS no longer just renders worlds, it learns to reprogram them on the fly."
